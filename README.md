<h2>Before You Learn How to Web Walk, You Have to Learn How to Web Crawl.</h2>
<p>This repository presents a web-based application that builds your future. In
  a way, of course. This application is built for MTU students who are
  frustrated with Banweb's usual interface.</p>
<p>So what does it do? Banweb Crawler presents you, the student, with
  schedule options that fit your needs, and your timeline. It builds you a
  custom schedule based on requirements that you set forth. In other words,
  Banweb Crawler is the academic advisor that listens.</p>
<p>This repository is split into two sub-projects. They are
  explained below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Python:</b> This directory contains the impelentation of the application
    in the programming language Python. Currently, this is the
    development branch.</li>
  <li><b>C-Perl:</b> This directory contains the implementation of the 
    application in the programming languages C and Perl. This branch, when 
    finished, has the potential to be faster than the Python branch, with 
    little expense regarding portability and security. This branch is not 
    currently in development.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to use this application</h3>
<p>Currently, this application is UNSTABLE, and under development. If you can
  manage to download the source and get it working yourself, well then good job.
  However, that's not something I recommend. When the application is finished,
  it will most likely be available as a <em>github.io</em> app. I will update
  this README when we have reached this milestone. Until then, please feel free
  to contribute any opinions or advice you may have, and peruse our code.
