<h2>Before You Learn How to Web Walk, You Have to Learn How to Web Crawl.</h2>
<p>This repository presents a web-based application that builds your future. In
  a way, of course. This application is built for MTU students who are
  frustrated with Banweb's usual interface.</p>
<p>So what does it do? Banweb Crawler builds presents you, the student, with
  schedule options that fit your needs, and your timeline. It builds you a
  custom schedule based on requirements that you set forth. In other words,
  Banweb Crawler is the academic advisor that listens.</p>
<p>This repository is split into three (currently) branches. These branches are
  explained below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Master:</b> The master branch contains only the web interface and
    project documentation. These can also be found in the source branches.</li>
  <li><b>Python:</b> This branch contains the impelentation of the application
    in the programming language Python. Currently, this is the
    development branch.</li>
  <li><b>C-Perl:</b> This branch contains the implementation of the application
    in the programming languages C and Perl. This branch, when finished, has the
    potential to be faster than the Python branch, with little expense
    regarding portability and security. This branch is not currently in
    development.<li>
</ul>
