<h1>An Application for Creating Schedules with MTU's Banweb Portal</h1>
<p>
  This repository contains code to implement a web crawler that
  generates actual student schedules with an attractive front-end.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Note:</i> This branch is impelemented in pure Python. Why? Because doing so
  allows me (the lone author of this program) to put more focus into developing
  an attractive user-interface. This repository also contains branches that
  implement the same program in pure C and Perl with embedded C for some of the
  trickier internals. Those branches can be viewed on
  <a href="https://github.com/AmateurECE/Banweb-Crawler">AmateurECE's Github</a>
