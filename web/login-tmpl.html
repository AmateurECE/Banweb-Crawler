    <!-- This document is where users enter their login information and
	 instructions to the program. These 'instructions' will most likely
	 come in the form of an HTML form or selection, and be passed to the
	 cgi script with named parameters. An example of some of the fields I
	 would like are:
	    * Required Courses: Courses that the program must put on every
		potential schedule.
	    * Degree Requirements: Requirements such as HASS, Core, etc., which
		the user would like the program to contribute a course for.
	    * Online classes: Tells the program whether or not to omit online 
		options, or return only online options.
	 This is just a few examples. If you come up with anything else, I
	 encourage you to speak up.
