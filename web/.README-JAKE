Heyo Jake,

So in this folder I have included a couple of templates for html files. They're
completely skeletal, but I've tried to comment the things that I'm looking for.
If at all possible, I would like for all of the potential schedules to be
displayed on the same page, with drop links that show/hide each schedule, kinda
like Wikipedia's mobile page. Also, and we can talk about this a little more in
detail later, I'm imagining for select forms on the login page a little feature
that inserts a new text box each time something is input into the previous one.
For example, the "Required Courses" option. Load the page with only one box for
this form, but then each time the field is filled, insert a new box. They can
be passed to the cgi script as like a csv list, or an array, or something?

Finally, I'm considering porting this whole application to Flask. Have you ever
used it? Would you have any qualms about that? It might make your life a little
easier. I suggest looking into that option, and let me know if that's something
you want to pursue. As always, if you have any questions, I'll be only a text
away.

Thanks,

-- Ethan
